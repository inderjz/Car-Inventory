  ## [Description](#table-of-contents)

  Our project is a Car Inventory. This project will help car enthusiasts add their cars on the website for others to view.

  I created this project because I am a car lover by myself and I want others to share their cars with eachother and see how much people like their car.

  This application can be used by anyone who just want to keep a car inventory of rare cars for sale.

  ## [Installation](#table-of-contents)

  First, clone the git repo into your device, and then navigate to the file, and run the following commands in your terminal 'npm init' and 'npm install'. 

  ## [Usage](#table-of-contents)

  After cloning the repo run the following command 'mysql -u root -p' at the root of your project and enter your password when promted, and then run the following commands 'source db/schema.sql' and then type quit.
