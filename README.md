  ## [Description](#table-of-contents)

  Our project is a Car Inventory. This project will help car enthusiasts add their cars on the website for others to view.

  I created this project because I am a car lover by myself and I want others to share their cars with eachother and see how much people like their car.

  This application can be used by anyone who just want to keep a car inventory of rare cars for sale.

  ## [Installation](#table-of-contents)
