  ## [Description](#table-of-contents)

Our project is a Car Inventory. This project will help car enthusiasts add their cars on the website for others to view. I created this project because I am a car lover by myself and I want others to share their cars with eachother and see how much people like their car. This application can be used by anyone who just want to keep a car inventory of rare cars for sale..

  ## [LandingPage](#table-of-contents)

  When you deploy the application you will have title of the project on the top and two navigation links of Home or Login, and when you scroll under there will be list of featured cars under there.

  ## [Usage](#table-of-contents)

  After you have pressed the Get started button you will enter the Note taker. On the left hand side you will have a column where it says No saved Notes on the top and once you have saved your notes that where all of your notes will be saved so whenever you come back at a later time your notes will still be there. On the right side you have place to write your Note title and your Note text and after you have completed writing press the save button on top right to save your notes. Next to the save button you have a pencil to delete everything you wrote on the current Notes. After you have saved a Note you will have a delete button on top right of the note to delete it.
